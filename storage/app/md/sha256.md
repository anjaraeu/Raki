## What does "sha256" mean ?

The [SHA-256 checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) is a method used in cryptography to check that 2 messages are the same. When you download a file, you can check that it was downloaded without problems by checking the checksum of these 2 files.

_Warning! The checksums are not case-sensitive, it means that a difference between upper and lower case letters doesn't make your download invalid._

### Comment on fait pour la calculer ?

#### Windows

If you are on Windows and you have 7-zip installed, it can help you calculate checksums.

Otherwise, you can use the Command Prompt with the command `certutil -hashfile C:\path\to\file SHA256`.

#### Mac OS

On Mac OS, you can use this command in a Shell : `shasum -a 256 /path/to/file`.

#### Linux

On Linux, you can use this command in a Shell :  `sha256sum /path/to/file`.
